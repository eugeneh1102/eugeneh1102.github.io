    <p>Once upon a time, there was a boy named Frank. He woke up and saw outside. snows were covered everywhere. He knew just what he needed to do- make a snowman! He rolled two big snowballs, one for the body and one for the head. He stacked them carefully, then added branches for arms, a small stone for eyes, and a carrot for a nose. Finally, he tied a red scarf(cheap) around the snowman's neck. Frank named him a Jim. Suddenly a witch came to his house and used a magical wand to make the snowman have feelings and move.</p>
