    <p class="Etparagraph">I use a tinkercad that has gravity so swing can swing. I didn't know that there was a mode like this but it was interesting. It was also fun when I could throw toys to my work. I used the hanging block so it could be and look like a swing and also can move like a swing.

    <p class="Etparagraph">I used tinkercad to make a catapult. It was fun when I finished making it. It was super easy. However, the stick for the base and spoon was so weak and easily broken. </p>
